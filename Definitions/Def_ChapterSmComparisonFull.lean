# The derivative coordinates of `N₀`, and the full comparison chain of the Standard Model

`BookProof.ChapterSmComparison` proves essential self-adjointness of the *dynamical* part of
the Standard-Model comparison operator `N₀` of `CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md` §D6b-SM.2 — the `40`
momentum-carrying coordinates, each contributing `π² + q⁴` (gluon, weak, Higgs) or `π² + q²`
(hypercharge) — and records as an honest boundary that

> the derivative-coordinate summands of `N₀` (multiplication operators with no conjugate
> momentum) are outside `sm_N_dyn_esa`, so “`N` is ESA on `C_c^∞`” is not claimed in full.

This module removes that boundary.  The point is that a derivative-coordinate summand
`Σ_j (Φ_{,j})²` is multiplication by the smooth real function `q ↦ q²`, and multiplication by
a smooth real function — with **no** growth, boundedness or semiboundedness hypothesis — is
essentially self-adjoint on the compactly supported smooth core
(`BookProof.ScalaronEsa.smoothPotential_essentiallySelfAdjoint`).  So a derivative coordinate
is an `EsaOp` in exactly the sense the tensor-sum chain consumes, and the chain can be
extended from `40` to `160` factors.

## What is proved

* `derivEsaOp` — one derivative coordinate: multiplication by `q²` on `L²(ℝ)`, essentially
  self-adjoint on the compactly supported smooth core;
* `deriv_coordinate_esa` — that statement on its own;
* `smFullChain`, **`sm_N_full_esa`** — the tensor sum of **all** `160` summands of `N₀`
  (`37` quartic + `3` quadratic dynamical factors and `120` derivative factors) is
  essentially self-adjoint on the algebraic tensor product of the `160` cores;
* `sm_N_full_stone_flow` — the unitary group it generates;
* `smFullChain_length` — the recount: `160` factors, one for each of the `163` collective
  coordinates of `BookProof.SmOneParticle.SmCoord` except the three spatial ones, which carry
  no summand of `N₀`.

As in `ChapterSmComparison`, the accounting identity of `bookGfTerm_eq_zero_of_Afield0`
(Cadabra PART F) applies: on `A₀ = 0` the BRST gauge-fixing term vanishes, so the full `N`
of record is `N₀ + c₀ I` with **no** additional gauge-fixing/ghost summand beyond the `160`
factors counted here.

## Honest boundary

As for `sm_N_dyn_esa`, the chain realizes the uncoupled sum on the tensor product of the
`160` one-dimensional spaces, which is the framework of `BookProof.ChapterTensorSumChain`;
this is a statement about `N₀`, not about the Standard-Model Hamiltonian `h`, and it does not
by itself give the Faris–Lavine hypotheses of §D6b-SM.3 for the bosonic sector (nor are they
needed there: the bosonic inner operator is a positive sum of squares, so the instrument is
Friedrichs).

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.

/-- **A derivative coordinate of `N₀`**: multiplication by `q²`, essentially self-adjoint on
the compactly supported smooth core of `L²(ℝ)`.  Unlike the dynamical factors it carries no
conjugate momentum — it is a pure multiplication operator — and its essential
self-adjointness comes from the smooth-potential theorem, not from a Schrödinger argument. -/
