# The spectral multiplication model without a cyclic vector (plan GAP-2, the assembly)

`ChapterSpectralMultiplication` identifies a normal operator **with a cyclic unit
vector** with multiplication by `z` on `L²(μ)`.  `ChapterCyclicDecomposition` and
`ChapterCyclicDirectSum` split an arbitrary complex Hilbert space into an orthogonal
direct sum of subspaces cyclic for the operator.  This module performs the
**assembly**: the model of a single cyclic summand is built inside the ambient space
(so that no functional calculus of a restricted operator is needed), and the
summand models are then glued over the decomposition.

* `cyclicSubspace_eq_closure_range`, `cfcVecTo`, `denseRange_cfcVecTo` — the
  generating map `f ↦ f(T)ξ` has dense range *in the cyclic subspace of `ξ`*;
* `cyclicUnitary` — since `‖f(T)ξ‖ = ‖f‖_{L²(μ_ξ)}` (`norm_cfcHom_apply`, proved
  with no cyclicity hypothesis), that map extends to a unitary
  `L²(μ_ξ) ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] cyclicSubspace ξ`;
* `cyclicEmbedding`, `range_cyclicEmbedding`, `cyclicEmbedding_intertwines_cfc`,
  `cyclicEmbedding_intertwines` — read in `H` it is an isometric embedding with range
  the cyclic subspace, carrying multiplication by a continuous symbol `g` into
  `g(T)`, in particular multiplication by `z` into `T`;
* HEADLINE `spectral_multiplication_model_general` — for **every** normal operator on
  a complex Hilbert space there are Borel probability measures `μₓ` on its spectrum
  and isometric embeddings `Vₓ : L²(μₓ) → H` exhibiting `H` as the Hilbert sum of the
  `L²(μₓ)`, with `T` acting on each summand as multiplication by the coordinate
  function.  No cyclic vector and no separability are assumed;
* `countable_orthogonalCyclicFamily` and
  `spectral_multiplication_model_separable` — on a *separable* space the family is
  countable (its members are unit vectors at pairwise distance `√2`), so the model is
  a countable direct sum.

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free (only `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`).
