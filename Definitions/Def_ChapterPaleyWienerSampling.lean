# Sampling for band-limited functions on the line (the Paley–Wiener picture)

`BookProof/ChapterShannonSampling.lean` proves the Whittaker–Shannon sampling theorem in the
*spectral* picture: the signal is *defined* as the inverse Fourier transform `bandSignal F` of a
square-integrable spectrum `F` over the band `[-T/2, T/2]`.  That left one gap, recorded there as
an honest boundary: the identification of that class with the genuinely band-limited functions of
the line, i.e. with the functions whose *own* Fourier transform vanishes outside the band.

This file closes that gap.  A function `f : ℝ → ℂ` is `BandLimited T` when it is continuous,
integrable, and its Fourier transform `𝓕 f` vanishes outside the band `|ξ| ≤ T/2`.  Then:

* `BandLimited.integrable_fourier` — the spectrum is continuous with compact support, hence
  integrable and bounded, so Fourier inversion applies;
* **`BandLimited.eq_bandSignal`** — `f` *is* the band-limited signal of its own spectrum, that
  spectrum being viewed (`bandSpectrumLp`) as a square-integrable function on the circle of
  circumference `T`;
* **`BandLimited.hasSum_sinc`** — the classical sampling theorem on the line:
  `f x = ∑_{n ∈ ℤ} f (n/T) · sinc (T x - n)` for every real `x`, an unconditionally convergent
  series;
* **`BandLimited.eq_of_samples_eq`** — a band-limited function is determined by its samples at
  the lattice `{n/T}`;
* **`BandLimited.hasSum_sq_samples`** — Parseval for the samples: `∑_n ‖f (n/T)‖²` converges to
  `T · ∫_ℝ ‖𝓕 f‖²`.

Everything is `sorry`-free and uses only the standard axioms.
