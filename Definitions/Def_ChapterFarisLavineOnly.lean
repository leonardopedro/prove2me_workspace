# Essential self-adjointness **only through Faris–Lavine**

The development contains three independent routes to essential self-adjointness of the
field-space Hamiltonians: the Carleman flux criterion
(`BookProof.FullQuadratic.fqOp_essentiallySelfAdjoint`, used by
`BookProof.QgOuterFock.sqSumOp_essentiallySelfAdjointOn`), the weighted Schur/Kato–Rellich
gates, and the commutator criterion of Faris–Lavine
(`BookProof.FarisLavine.essentiallySelfAdjointOn_of_farisLavine`).

Only the last one **lifts** from the one-particle Hilbert space to the outer Fock space.
The reason is structural and is made explicit here:

* a Faris–Lavine certificate consists of a comparison operator `N` — always the Friedrichs
  extension of a positive one-particle operator — and a commutator bound `±i[H,N] ≤ cN`;
* the Friedrichs extension lifts to the `ℓ²`-direct sum (`dsComparison`: symmetry,
  positivity and surjectivity of `N + 1` are fibrewise, and the fibre solutions of
  `(N+1)x = f` are automatically square-summable), and
* the commutator form of the lift is the **sum** of the fibre commutator forms
  (`dsFibOp_hasSum_commForm`), so the bound lifts with the *same* constant `c`.

Neither of the other two routes has this property: a Carleman flux estimate and a Schur
weight are statements about a *fixed* one-particle basis and its shells, and nothing in them
survives the passage to `⊕ₙ L²(ℝ^{d·n})` — the number of shells of the `n`-particle sector
grows with `n`, and the constants degrade.

This module therefore replaces the Carleman route by the Faris–Lavine route at the place it
enters the main line: the essential self-adjointness of a kinetic-plus-squares Hamiltonian
**on the Gauss–polynomial core itself**.

## What is proved

* `BookProof.QgOuterFockCoreFL.CoreData.esa_on_core` — the missing abstract step:
  Faris–Lavine gives essential self-adjointness not merely of the extension `ext` on the
  whole domain of the comparison operator, but of the original operator **on the graph core**
  (the relative bound transports the graph approximation of `N` to a graph approximation of
  `H`, which is exactly the hypothesis of
  `BookProof.FarisLavine.essentiallySelfAdjointOn_restrict_of_graph_core`).
* `sqSumOp_esa_farisLavine` — **the Faris–Lavine replacement for
  `BookProof.QgOuterFock.sqSumOp_essentiallySelfAdjointOn`**: for an arbitrary real signature
  `κ` and an arbitrary finite family of linear forms, `½ Σ_j κ_j π_j² + ½ Σ_r L_r²` is
  essentially self-adjoint on the Gauss–polynomial core of `L²(ℝᴰ)`, proved from the two
  Faris–Lavine inequalities of `BookProof.ChapterSqSumFarisLavine` against the Friedrichs
  oscillator `N₁ = −Δ + ‖x‖²/4`, with no Carleman flux estimate anywhere.  The Schur data
  are supplied by the trivial bounds, so the statement carries no hypotheses.
* `SqFamily.secHam_esa_fl`, `SqFamily.outerHam_esa_fl` — the same for every sector of a
  uniform family, and hence for the Hamiltonian on the finite-particle core of the outer
  Fock space: **the finite-particle-core statement, too, is now Faris–Lavine only.**
* `SqFamily.esa_farisLavine` — the certificate itself, collected in one statement: the
  comparison operator is the lifted Friedrichs extension, the relative bound and the
  commutator bound hold with constants `flK`, `flc` independent of the particle number, and
  the conclusion is essential self-adjointness on the lifted domain together with the
  extension property on the finite-particle core.

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.
