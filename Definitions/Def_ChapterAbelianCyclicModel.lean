# Abelian algebras with a cyclic vector: the multiplication model (plan GAP-2)

`ChapterSpectralMultiplication` proves the multiplication model for a **singly
generated** abelian algebra: a normal operator `T` with a cyclic unit vector is
multiplication by `z` on `L²(μ)`.  The obstruction recorded there — and in
`BookProof/STATUS.md` — was the passage from a singly generated abelian algebra to
an *arbitrary* one, which the classical theory obtains by producing a single
generator.

This module removes the need for a generator.  The whole argument of
`ChapterSpectralMultiplication` is carried out for an **arbitrary unital
`*`-representation** `π : C(X, ℂ) →⋆ₐ[ℂ] (H →L[ℂ] H)` of the continuous functions on
a compact Hausdorff space, with a cyclic unit vector `ξ`:

* `repState` — `f ↦ ⟪ξ, π(f) ξ⟫` is a state of `C(X, ℂ)`; positivity is
  `⟪ξ, π(f̄f)ξ⟫ = ‖π(f)ξ‖²`, which uses only that `π` preserves products and stars
  (no continuity of `π` is assumed anywhere in this file);
* `repMeasure` — its Riesz measure, a regular Borel probability measure on `X`, with
  `integral_repMeasure : ⟪ξ, π(f)ξ⟫ = ∫ f dμ`;
* `norm_rep_apply` — the isometry `‖π(f)ξ‖ = ‖f‖_{L²(μ)}`;
* `cyclicRepUnitary` — hence `f ↦ π(f)ξ` extends to a **unitary**
  `U : L²(μ) ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] H`;
* `cyclicRepUnitary_intertwines` and HEADLINE
  `cyclic_representation_multiplication_model` — `U` conjugates multiplication by
  `g` on `L²(μ)` into `π(g)`, for *every* continuous symbol `g` simultaneously.

Composing with Gelfand duality gives the form the classification programme needs
(`abelian_algebra_multiplication_model`): **every representation of a commutative
unital C\*-algebra `A` on a Hilbert space with a cyclic unit vector is unitarily
equivalent to the representation of `A` by multiplication operators on the `L²`
space of a Borel probability measure on the character space of `A`** — no
generator, no separability, no normality of a distinguished element.

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.
