# The induced system on `L²(X, μ; K)` with a multiplicity (fibre) Hilbert space

`BookProof.ChapterPvmInducedSystem` writes an arbitrary projection-valued measure as the
`ℓ²`-sum of the multiplication systems of the cyclic pieces, indexed by a multiplicity set
`S`.  `BookProof.ChapterL2FibreSum` identifies, for a countable index `ι`, the `ℓ²`-sum of
copies of `L²(X, μ)` with the vector-valued space `L²(X, μ; ℓ²(ι))` of Mackey's *induced*
system.  Putting the two together gives the induced system in the form of
`BookProof.ChapterMackeyQuasiInvariant`: a **single** unitary onto `L²(X, μ; K)` with the
fibre (multiplicity) Hilbert space `K = ℓ²(ι)`, carrying `P(E)` to multiplication by `1_E`.

## Results

* `lpCongr` — the identification of the `L²` spaces of two equal measures, and
  `lpCongr_symm_proj`, its compatibility with multiplication by indicators.
* **`induced_system_of_isHilbertSum`** — if `H` is the Hilbert sum of countably many copies
  of `L²(X, μ)` along isometries carrying multiplication by `1_E` to `P(E)`, then there is a
  unitary `W : H ≃ L²(X, μ; ℓ²(ι))` with `W (P(E) v) = 1_E · W v`: the system *is* the
  induced one on the fibre `ℓ²(ι)`.
* **`pvm_induced_system_homogeneous`** — the concrete form: a projection-valued measure with
  a countable total orthogonal cyclic family whose fibre measures are all the *same* measure
  `μ` (homogeneous multiplicity) is unitarily the multiplication system on `L²(X, μ; ℓ²(S))`.

Everything is `sorry`-free and uses only the standard axioms.
