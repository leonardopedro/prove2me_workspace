# An explicit smooth real potential whose Schrödinger operator is *not* essentially
# self-adjoint

`BookProof/ChapterScalaronWallEsa.lean` proves that `−d²/dx² + V` is essentially self-adjoint
on the compactly supported smooth core of `L²(ℝ)` for **every** smooth `V ≥ 0`, with no growth
hypothesis.  `CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md`'s QG-2 sign warning is that the *opposite* sign class is
genuinely different: a potential unbounded below can put the operator in the Weyl limit-circle
regime, where both deficiency indices are positive and essential self-adjointness fails.  The
plan's Case B (the densitized conformal direction) is exactly of that kind, and the plan
records it as **false** — but that was an informal appeal to the classical `−d²/dx² − x⁴`
example.

This module removes the appeal by exhibiting a concrete potential and a concrete deficiency
vector, so the failure is a Lean theorem.

## The construction

Instead of starting from a potential and solving the ODE, we start from the solution.  Write
`W = e^{p + iq}` with `p, q` real; then

`W''/W = (p'' + p'² − q'²) + i(q'' + 2p'q')`,

so `W` solves `W'' = (V − i)W` for the *real* potential `V = p'' + p'² − q'²` as soon as
`q'' + 2p'q' = −1`, and `W ∈ L²` as soon as `e^{2p}` is integrable (the phase `q` is
irrelevant to the modulus).  Choosing

`q'(x) = −(1 + x²)/2`,  hence  `p'(x) = (1 − x)/(1 + x²)`,  `p(x) = arctan x − ½log(1 + x²)`,

makes the imaginary equation an identity, and `e^{2p(x)} = e^{2 arctan x}/(1 + x²) ≤ e^{π}/(1 + x²)`
is integrable.  The resulting potential

`V(x) = (2x² − 4x)/(1 + x²)² − (1 + x²)²/4`

is smooth, real, and behaves like `−x⁴/4` at infinity — the classical limit-circle profile.

## What is proved

* `lcSol_isL2Ode` — the explicit `W` is a square-integrable classical solution of
  `W'' = (lcV − i)W`;
* `lcSol_ne_zero` — it never vanishes;
* `lcV_not_deficiencyTrivialAt_I` — hence the deficiency space of `−d²/dx² + lcV` at `i` is
  nontrivial;
* **`lcV_not_essentiallySelfAdjoint`** — so `−d²/dx² + lcV` is **not** essentially
  self-adjoint on the compactly supported smooth core;
* `exists_smooth_potential_not_essentiallySelfAdjoint` — the existence statement: there is a
  smooth real potential on the line whose Schrödinger operator fails to be essentially
  self-adjoint on that core.  Combined with `wallHam_essentiallySelfAdjoint`, this shows the
  non-negativity hypothesis there cannot simply be dropped.
