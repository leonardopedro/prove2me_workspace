# Chapter "Wave-function parametrization of a probability measure", §5 —
# the orbit–stabilizer identity for the Born sign gauge

Source: `book.tex`, chapter *"Wave-function parametrization of a probability
measure"* — the free-field construction of §5 (`book.tex` ~line 1706) and the
Introduction's remark (`book.tex` ~line 805) that the wave function is *one
possible* parametrization of a probability distribution.

Earlier waves established that the diagonal `{±1}ⁿ` sign group acts on the unit
sphere with `bornMap (signFlip s x) = bornMap x`, that each Born fiber is a full
orbit of the sign group restricted to the positive support, and that
`#fiber = 2 ^ (#positive coordinates)`.

This wave records the **orbit–stabilizer** picture of that action. Indexing the
sign group by boolean choices (`boolSign`), for a fixed wave function `x` on the
sphere the **stabilizer** — the sign flips that fix `x` — is exactly the flips
supported on the *vanishing* coordinates of `x`, so it has `2 ^ (#zero
coordinates)` elements. Combined with the fiber (= orbit) count this yields the
orbit–stabilizer identity `#orbit · #stabilizer = 2 ^ n`, the order of the whole
diagonal sign group.

## Main results

* `boolSign_pm` — `boolSign b k = ±1`.
* `mem_signStab` — `b ∈ signStab x ↔ ∀ k, x k ≠ 0 → b k = true`.
* `signStab_card` — `#(signStab x) = 2 ^ (#zero coordinates of x)`.
* `signStab_card_mul_two_pow_nonzero` — `#stabilizer · 2 ^ (#nonzero) = 2 ^ n`.
* `posSupport_bornMap` — `posSupport (bornMap x) = {k : x k ≠ 0}`.
* **headline** `bornFiber_card_mul_signStab_card` — `#fiber · #stabilizer = 2ⁿ`.

Everything is intended to be `sorry`-free and axiom-clean.

A sign flip fixes `x` iff it is `+1` on every nonzero coordinate of `x`.

/-
The stabilizer of `x` under the sign gauge has `2 ^ (#zero coordinates)`
elements: the sign choices on the vanishing coordinates are free, while the
nonzero coordinates are forced to `+1`.

**Orbit–stabilizer (arithmetic form).** The stabilizer size times
`2 ^ (#nonzero coordinates)` equals the order `2 ^ n` of the diagonal sign
group.

/-
`posSupport (bornMap x)` is exactly the set of nonzero coordinates of `x`
(since `bornMap x k = (x k)² > 0 ↔ x k ≠ 0`).

/-
**Headline (orbit–stabilizer).** For a wave function `x` on the unit sphere,
the Born fiber over `bornMapSphere x` (the orbit of the sign gauge) times the
sign-gauge stabilizer of `x` equals the order `2 ^ n` of the whole diagonal sign
group.
