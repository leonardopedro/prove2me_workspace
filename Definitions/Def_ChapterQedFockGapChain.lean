# Chapter QedFockGapChain — the gap chain for QED, and what masslessness costs

`CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md`, next-steps item **2** of the 2026-08-28j block: *instantiate the
chain for QED — and say what the masslessness means.*

The free photon's one-particle energy is diagonal in the mode basis with the massless
dispersion `ω_k = |k|`, so the diagonal chain of `ChapterFockDiagonalGapChain` applies
directly — but only at `m = 0`.  This module records exactly that, and, so that the
statement cannot be misread as a photon mass gap, it also *proves the obstruction*: if the
momentum assignment accumulates at zero (the physical infrared situation), then for every
`m > 0` the one-particle form gap `⟪x, D x⟫ ≥ m‖x‖²` is **false** on the core.

## What is proved

* `diagOnePart_quadForm_basis` — the diagonal form on a single mode is that mode's energy.
* `diagOnePart_no_form_gap` — *no* form gap above any mode energy: if `ω_k < m` for some
  mode `k`, there is a unit core vector on which the diagonal form is `< m‖x‖²`.
* `photonDispersion`, `photonDispersion_nonneg` — the massless dispersion `ω_k = |p_k|`.
* **`photon_fock_positivity`** — the honest unconditional QED statement: the second
  quantization of the photon energy annihilates the outer vacuum and is non-negative on
  every finite-particle state.  This is `diag_fock_gap` at `m = 0`; the gap is `0`.
* **`photon_no_one_particle_gap`** — the obstruction: for an infrared-accumulating momentum
  assignment (`∀ ε > 0, ∃ k, |p_k| < ε`) and *every* `m > 0`, the one-particle form gap
  fails.  So no instantiation of the chain can produce a positive photon mass gap.
* **`irPhoton_fock_mass_gap`** — with an infrared regulator `μ > 0` imposed on the mode
  energies (`ω_k = max μ |p_k|`), the diagonal chain gives the nested-Fock mass gap `μ`.
* **`proca_fock_mass_gap`** — with a massive (Proca-type) one-particle energy
  `ω_k = √(p_k² + m²)`, `m > 0`, the chain gives the nested-Fock mass gap `m`.

## Honest boundary

The free-photon instantiation yields positivity and **no gap**; that is a feature of
massless dispersion, not a deficiency of the chain, and `photon_no_one_particle_gap` proves
that no positive gap is available at the one-particle level in the infrared-accumulating
case.  The gapped statements above are statements about the *regulated* (`μ > 0`) and
*massive* (Proca) one-particle energies, which are modelling replacements for the photon
energy, not theorems about physical QED.  No photon mass is claimed anywhere.

Everything is `sorry`-free and introduces no axioms.
