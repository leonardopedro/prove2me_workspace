# Chapter FockCubicUnbounded — the quadratic degree is the boundary

`ChapterFockFieldPerturbation` proves that a gap survives a *linear* field coupling
`Φ(f) = a†(f) + a(f)`, and `ChapterFockPairPerturbation` that it survives a *quadratic*,
pair-creating coupling `P(f,g) = a†(f)a†(g) + a(g)a(f)`.  Both proceed by dominating the
perturbing form by the free form `Re⟪u, dΓ(h)u⟫`.  Every status update of
`CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md` then records the same honest boundary: the *cubic and quartic*
Yang–Mills interaction terms are not covered.

This chapter shows that this is not a gap in the write-up but a fact about the route: the
domination that the linear and quadratic couplings admit **fails outright** at degree three.

## Deliverables

* `cubeA k` — the single-mode cubic field term `C_k = (a_k†)³ + (a_k)³`, self-adjoint,
  unbounded, and changing the particle number by three;
* `trial_numberQuad`, `trial_norm_sq`, `trial_cubic_form` — the exact values of the three
  relevant quantities on the two-term trial states `|n⟩ + c|n+3⟩`: the number form
  `n + (n+3)c²`, the squared norm `1 + c²`, and the cubic form `2c√((n+1)(n+2)(n+3))`;
* **`cubic_no_relative_form_bound`** — for *every* pair of constants `a, b` there is a
  vacuum-orthogonal finite-particle state with
  `a·⟪u, N u⟫ + b‖u‖² < Re⟪u, C_k u⟫`.  So the cubic term admits **no** relative form bound
  of the shape `|v| ≤ a q + b‖·‖²` against the number form — the hypothesis of
  `FockInteractionStability.gap_persists_of_relative_form_bound` can never be met by it,
  however small the coupling constant is made;
* **`fock_gap_fails_for_cubic`** — the consequence for the gap: for the free Fock
  Hamiltonian `dΓ(N)` (one-particle gap `1`) and *any* coupling strength `lam > 0`, the
  perturbed form `dΓ(N) + lam·C_k` is **unbounded below** on the vacuum-orthogonal sector:
  for every `M` there is a vacuum-orthogonal state with
  `Re⟪u, dΓ(N)u⟫ + lam·Re⟪u, C_k u⟫ ≤ -M‖u‖²`.

Together with `ChapterFockPairPerturbation`, this locates the boundary exactly: degree two
survives (with a smallness condition), degree three does not survive at all.

A final section makes the complementary point precise.  `quartA k = (a_k†)²(a_k)²` is the
normal-ordered quartic term, diagonal with eigenvalue `m(m − 1)` (`quartA_single_confAt`,
`trial_quartic_form`), and **`trial_cubic_quartic_bounded_below`** shows that on the very
family of states that drives `dΓ(N) + lam·C_k` to `-∞`, the sum
`dΓ(N) + lam·C_k + Q_k` is bounded below by `-(lam⁴/4 + 2lam²)‖u‖²`, uniformly in the
occupation number and in the mixing coefficient.  The divergence above is therefore a
property of a *bare* cubic term.

## Honest boundary

`C_k` is a single-mode cubic term, not the full Yang–Mills cubic vertex; what is proved is
that *this* form-domination route cannot reach degree three, not that no gap exists for the
physical theory — a physical cubic term is accompanied by a quartic term which is bounded
below, and controlling their sum in general is a different problem, of which only the
statement along the above trial family is proved here.  `1.932` remains a certified
truncated number; no mass gap of the physical Hamiltonian is claimed.

Everything is `sorry`-free and introduces no axioms.
