# Separability is exactly metrizability of the spectrum (plan GAP-2, the last residue)

`ChapterStandardBorelClassification` proves the exhaustiveness half of the abelian
von Neumann classification — every summand of the general abelian multiplication model
realises one of the manuscript's five standard types — under one standing hypothesis:
the compact space `Y` carrying the model (the spectrum) is **metrizable**.  This module
removes the hypothesis from the list of unexplained assumptions by identifying it with
a purely algebraic condition and by discharging it in the standard setting.

* `metrizableSpace_of_separable_continuousMap` — a compact Hausdorff space whose
  algebra `C(Y, ℂ)` is *separable* is metrizable.  The proof is the classical one:
  a countable dense family of continuous functions separates points (Urysohn), so it
  embeds `Y` into a countable power of `ℂ`, and a continuous injection out of a compact
  space into a Hausdorff space is an embedding;
* `separableSpace_continuousMap_of_metrizable` — the converse;
* `metrizableSpace_iff_separableSpace_continuousMap` — hence, for a compact Hausdorff
  spectrum, *metrizability of the spectrum and separability of the algebra are the same
  hypothesis*;
* `metrizableSpace_characterSpace` — via Gelfand duality, the character space of a
  **separable** commutative unital C\*-algebra is metrizable;
* **HEADLINE** `abelian_multiplication_model_classified_separable` and
  `abelian_algebra_multiplication_model_classified` — the classification list with the
  metrizability hypothesis replaced by separability of the algebra: every unital
  `*`-representation of a separable commutative unital C\*-algebra on a complex Hilbert
  space is a direct sum of multiplication algebras, each of which realises one of the
  five standard types.

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.
